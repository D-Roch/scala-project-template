Scala Project Template
======================

This is a template project for open-source Scala projects.  It's intended to reduce the overheads of publishing some useful code to the community as a library.  The idea is that you just copy this project and then make it your own.

It provides (or goes some way to providing, or will provide!):

* publishing process control using [sbt-release](https://github.com/gseitz/sbt-release) which simplifies updating release versions but also provides some checks to make sure your release is suitable for publishing.
* publishing to [ls.implicit.ly](http://ls.implicit.ly/) using [ls-sbt](https://github.com/softprops/ls) to make it easier for others to find your library.
* publishing to [implicit.ly](http://implicit.ly/) using [posterous-sbt](https://github.com/n8han/posterous-sbt) for those who like to following the latest Scala library releases.
* deployment to the Sonatype Maven repository.

Version: 0.2-SNAPSHOT

This code is currently under development.

This template is not complete and I have yet to document what you need to change to make this work for you!
